# grpCox
Penalized Cox Model for High-Dimensional Data with Grouped Predictors
Fit the penalized Cox models with both non-overlapping and overlapping grouped penalties including the group lasso, group smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), 
and group minimax concave (MCP) penalty. 
The algorithms combine the MM approach and group-wise descent with some computational tricks including the screening, active set, and warm-start. 
Different tuning regularization parameter methods are provided.
